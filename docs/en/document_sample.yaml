  description: |
    This document explains the long-form content support features in YAML.
    While YAML is a structured data format, it can also handle long-form text effectively.
    Below, we demonstrate specific methods and usage examples.

requirements:
  functional:
    - Support for multi-line text
    - Markdown syntax support
    - Table formatting
  non_functional:
    - Readable format
    - Version control friendly
  constraints:
    - Must follow YAML syntax rules

writing_long_content:
  basic_syntax: |
    In YAML, you can use the '|' (pipe) symbol to write multi-line text
    while preserving line breaks exactly as written.
    Indentation is preserved, and line breaks at the end of each line are maintained.

  folded_syntax: >
    When you use the '>' (greater than) symbol, multi-line text will be
    folded into a single line. Empty lines are used to separate paragraphs.
    This is useful when writing long content.

    As shown here, an empty line creates a new paragraph.

markup_usage:
  markdown_syntax: |
    You can use **Markdown syntax** within YAML.
    
    - List item 1
    - List item 2
    
    ### Subheading
    
    1. Numbered list
    2. Second item
    
    ```python
    def example():
        print("Code blocks are supported")
    ```

table_examples:
  table_syntax: |
    | Item | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | YAML | Data structure definition language |
    | Markdown | Lightweight markup language |
    | PDF | Printable document format |
